## ðŸ›  How We Built It
### Backend (Flask-based RESTful API):
- Flask & Flask-CORS for API development.
- OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text transcription.
- GPT-4 for summarization.
- Sentence Transformers for semantic search with cosine similarity.
- Redis caching to store transcripts & summaries.
- FFmpeg for extracting audio from video files.
- PyTorch for handling embeddings and search.
