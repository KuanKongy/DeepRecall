# Welcome to DeepRecall
As college students, we often sit through hours of lectures, online courses, and study sessions, only to struggle when trying to find key concepts later. Rewatching long videos or skimming through notes isnâ€™t always an efficient option.
We wanted to build a tool that could automatically transcribe, summarize, and search lecture recordings, making it easier to review material, find important topics instantly, and save time studying. Whether you're preparing for exams, catching up on missed classes, or revisiting complex topics, DeepRecall ensures you never miss a crucial moment in your learning journey. ðŸš€
